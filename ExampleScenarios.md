Here are three simple example scenarios that illustrate how "Prudent Pot" can be played, showcasing the strategic
decisions players might face:

### Example Scenario 1: Strategic Allocation

- **Context**: The game begins with each of the 5 pots having 10 tokens. Player A decides to allocate 20 tokens to Pot
  3, believing that it will end with an even number of tokens.
- **Action**: Player A allocates 20 tokens to Pot 3. After the 2% allocation fee, 19.6 tokens are added to Pot 3.
- **Outcome**: At the game's end, Pot 3 has an even number of tokens and is declared the winning pot. Player A's
  strategic bet pays off, earning them a significant share of the total tokens.

### Example Scenario 2: Reallocation Tactics

- **Context**: Mid-game, Player B notices that Pot 4 is likely to be the lowest and thus the winning pot. They decide to
  reallocate 10 tokens from Pot 2 to Pot 4.
- **Action**: Player B reallocates 10 tokens. After the 5% reallocation fee, 9.5 tokens are added to Pot 4.
- **Outcome**: Player B's reallocation changes the dynamics, making Pot 4 the winning pot. Their timely decision allows
  them to secure a share of the winnings from Pot 4.

### Example Scenario 3: Diverse Strategies

- **Context**: Players C and D adopt different strategies. Player C spreads their tokens across multiple pots to hedge
  their bets, while Player D concentrates all their tokens in Pot 1, predicting it will have the median number of
  tokens.
- **Action**: Player C distributes tokens evenly, while Player D goes all-in on Pot 1.
- **Outcome**: The game concludes with Pot 1 having the median number of tokens, rewarding Player D's focused strategy.
  Player C, with a more conservative approach, gains smaller shares from multiple pots.
